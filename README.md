# blockchain-game-Connect-Four
this is a game develop by solidity and it is a connect four chess game, like tictactoc;  
-----12.28 update------  
The UI was changed at this update, I used the bootstrap to make it more beatuiful and friendly.  
At this update, I delete two functions in the TicTacToc.sol cause it is useless, this delete passed the test.  
The setting about the webpack has been changed , I added url-loader to make the background picture can show properly.  
After complete the index.js, the ui will show the address of the player and it can remind who is the next player.  
I tested it on the firefox and chrome, using metamask and it works fine.
